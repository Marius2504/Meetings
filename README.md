Meeting application

## Description
I've developed a console application in C++ that efficiently identifies free time intervals within a given set. 
The purpose is to find a suitable time slot that works for multiple individuals, excluding weekends (Saturday and Sunday). 
The application is developed using Greedy approach, providing a convenient way to identify available time windows.

## Implementation
Application is designed with OOP principales aiming for best results

## Performance
Time Complexity O(nlogn)
Space Complexity O(n)

## How to use ?
In order to find the best schedule time, you must insert data on each day of the week (excluding Saturday and Sunday).
Every day of the week has a corresponding .txt file.
Input data must follow a format of "HH:MM - HH:MM".
